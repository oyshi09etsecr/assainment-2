<h5 style="color: darkgray;">Facebook – Connecting People
For example, Facebook changed the way we connect<br> with people and stay in touch with our friends 
by  building a social graph. In the  past,<br> we used to have to go to each other’s houses to look at each other’s photo albums.
<br>Nowadays, all we have to do is to upload our photos and tag each other on facebook.</h6>

    <h2>I will Do Coding and Change The<br> World.</h2>

<p style="color: rgb(46, 57, 26);box-shadow: 20px;">Nobody denies it’s difficult to learn to code (and if they do, they’re also lying), but that’s what makes learning to code worth your while and extra rewarding. Our motto here at Coder Factory Academy definitely includes the common phrase, “You get out what you put in.”

    You don’t need to learn every single language, platform, or tool that comes up…and you can’t, either. Stay focussed in your endeavours and learn only what’s relevant to what you want to achieve. </p>
